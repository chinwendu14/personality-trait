          Do you enjoy spending time socializing with others in the outer world?
          Does the thought of meeting new people make you feel energized? If you
          identify with these traits, you might be an extrovert. Figuring out
          where you fall on the personality spectrum can be challenging. In
          fact, it can be argued that everyone spends time being more
          extroverted and introverted.

        <p>
          In public and at work you are a ball of energy perpetually on the
          move. You take the initiative, encourage others, hate waiting and are
          endlessly anticipating whatâ€™s going on around you. You take real
          pleasure in managing everything, much like the conductor of an
          orchestra. You enjoy being noticed by your work peers and your anxiety
          is linked more to the thought of leaving others indifferent.
