        <p>
          An introvert is a person with qualities of a personality type known as
          introversion, which means that they feel more comfortable focusing on
          their inner thoughts and ideas, rather than what’s happening
          externally. They enjoy spending time with just one or two people,
          rather than large groups or crowds.
        </p>
        <p>
          You feel that living alone is to live happily, and you prefer hiding
          in a crowd rather than standing out in one. You are perpetually
          tormented by the idea of doing things wrong, not understanding or not
          being alert enough or intelligent enough to do what others expect of
          you. You lack in self-confidence and you seem to believe that others
          are better than you. While in a conversation, for example, you would
          be more likely to go along with the other’s points of view as you
          don’t fully respect your own opinions. Where there’s a low level task
          to complete or a service to be allotted, it’s you who volunteers. When
          people want to get out of a task, they naturally come to you as they
          know that you never say ‘no’.
